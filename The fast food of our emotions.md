# The fast food of our emotions

Although today's hyper-connected society allows us to contact both a stranger on the other side of the planet and the person we hold most dear, it also standardizes our conversations in a certain way.

Emojis. These little images that we see and use everywhere, in every situation, in every conversation, and with anyone.

If, when reading the previous sentence, you said to yourself "No, look, in my business emails sent to my boss or my clients, there are no emojis, and I'm glad there aren't!", then you'd unwittingly be admitting to me that you're standardizing the conversations that matter to you rather than the others.

Designed so that every individual, whatever their culture, beliefs or identity, can express and represent their own singular emotions in this standardized system, emojis dictate the way we express anger, joy, sadness and love.

When you think about it, you might say that the words of a language are also based on phonetic and semantic standards, and that in the end, the words "I love you" are just a way of expressing a deep feeling that we no longer think about. 

Yet a language is a consciousness, a way of conceiving life, the world around us, our thoughts and all the concepts associated with them.

When you have a new idea, it only exists because you can conceptualize it and express it in your head in the language(s) you know.

Where the famous expression "a picture is worth a thousand words" would favour an icon rather than a set of words to accurately describe a feeling or a message, I would reply that "words have meaning" and that striving to combine words correctly helps to structure the expression of one's thoughts.

In the medical and psychological fields, we already try to identify similarities in symptoms, behaviors and reactions of individuals, so that occurrences become recurrences.

With the democratization of social networking platforms has also come Sentiment Analysis, also known as "opinion or emotion extraction", with the aim of accurately analyzing an individual's feelings when they express themselves.

This is what the social network Snapchat does, among other things, by detecting in real time the nature and level of emotion of your message as you type it, to suggest the emoji to use to accompany it.

You don't even have to think about your own emotions anymore, a linguistic model tells you which image best matches what you're feeling, based on what you're writing.

That's how we get back to emojis, which have theorized a panel of standard emotions, which you voluntarily and explicitly choose to express your complex yet unique emotions with your surroundings with simplicity.

So, the next time you send a message to someone close to you, will you punctuate it with a heart emoji or a smile, or with words that describe how you're feeling right now?
